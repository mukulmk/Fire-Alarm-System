# Fire Alarm System

This system checks for abnormal smoke content in a room and under such conditions throws open all exit doors and windows and opens a valve that releases the gas to put-out the fire. An Alarm is also sounded; this alarm is sounded until the smoke level in the room drops to an acceptable level. The room has two doors and four windows. The smoke detection system is made up of two smoke sensors placed on the ceiling of the room. When both detectors get turned on, the alarm system is activated.
